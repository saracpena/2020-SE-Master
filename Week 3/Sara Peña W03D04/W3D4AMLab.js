// OOP - Inheritance 

// Create a class called Fish 

// Define a method Swim( )
// Create a class Nemo that inherits from Fish
// Define an attribute color
// Create a Nemo object. Can it swim? 
// Find the difference between abstract class and an interface
// Which of the two can have implementation of a method in the class?

class Fish{//CLASS
