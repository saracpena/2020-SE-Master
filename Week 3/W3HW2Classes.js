// OOP: Classes

// Let's create shaped objects

// Define a new class called Circle with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Circle objects.
// Write a function called circle_area that returns the area of the object. 
// Write a function total_sides that returns the number of sides of the object.
// Define a new class called Rectangle with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Rectangle objects.
// Write a function called rectangle_area that returns the area of the given object.
// Write a function total_sides that returns the number of sides of the object.
// Define a new class called Square with appropriate attributes and instantiate a few Square objects.
// Write a function called square_area that returns the area of the given object.
// Write a function total_sides that returns the number of sides of the object.
