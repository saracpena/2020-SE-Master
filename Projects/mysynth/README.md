### What is BabySynth?

BabySynth is a small synthesizer keyboard that plays 8 notes total and can only be played by clicking through the keys. These notes include white keys which are the natural notes 'C thru G' and 3 black keys which are sharp/flat notes 'C# D# and F#'.

In addition, there are a couple buttons that play an arpeggio of the C major 7 chord and a reversed C chord. Arpeggios simply play a chord one note at a time.

### Sources

I sought out my sources from Tone.js and installed the librairies from https://tonejs.github.io/


### Wishlist Ideas

    * Eventually I'd like to include a couple buttons that shape the sounds of the keyboard also known as filters. This filter can change the shapes/lengths/pitch of each sound when engaged.

    * I'd like to include a mod wheel and a volume level with an on/off switch.

    * Ability to connect a midi keyboard.

    * WhiteKeys to become the Keyboard Component, which renders separate compoments WhiteKeys and BlackKeys
