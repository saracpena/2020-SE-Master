# Introduction: 
    BabySynth began as a single button that would output a musical synth note. After several iterations it quickly turned into what is now a 13-key BabySynth Keyboard. These notes include white keys which are the natural notes 'C thru upper octave C' and 5 black keys which are sharp/flat notes 'C# thru A#'. Included are two buttons that play C Major arpeggios, which play a C Major Chord one note at a time with the click of a button.

# Technologies used:
    ReactJS
    HTML5
    CSS3
    JavaScript

# The approach: 
    Created a parent component, App.js which imports children components, "WhiteKeys.js, BlackKeys.js, and PlayChord.js" and deployed BabySynth on github using ReactJS through an index.html entry point using an index.js

# Unsolved problems:
    Successfully align "key note" names

# User stories
    

# Personal notes so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
    
    ### Wishlist Ideas

    * Eventually I'd like to include a couple buttons that shape the sounds of the keyboard also known as filters. This filter can change the shapes/lengths/pitch of each sound when engaged.

    * I'd like to include a mod wheel and a volume level as well as an on/off switch

    * Ability to connect a midi keyboard

    * WhiteKeys to become the 'main' Keyboard Component, which renders separate compoments WhiteKeys and BlackKeys


# BabySynth Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To try it out on your own system:

    git fork https://github.com/saracpena/2020-SE-Master/tree/main/Projects/mysynth

    To just run the app as is:

    npm install
    npm start
    and go to http://localhost:3000.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Sources

    Compliments of Tone.js and installed the librairies from https://tonejs.github.io/
