// Sorts

// Sort the sequence 4 6 8 2 9 5 1 7 3 by hand with:
// Insertion sort
// Quicksort (picking the first element as the pivot)
// Quicksort (using the median-of-three pivot)
// Mergesort
// Bottom-up mergesort using runs
// Sort the sequence   2152    3180    725    1781    1248    4590    2990    633   by hand: 
// Insertion sort
// Quicksort (picking the first element as the pivot)
// Quicksort (using the median-of-three pivot)
// Mergesort
// Bottom-up mergesort using run
 
//  3.  Suppose that you want to sort the books on your bookshelf, say into alphabetical order, by hand. What would be a good algorithm for doing this?

// Does the answer change if you have very many (say thousands) of books? Does it depend on what order the books are currently in?

// 4. can you use sorting to remove all duplicate elements from the list 4 1 6 3 8 4 2 9 4 5 1 7 3?
